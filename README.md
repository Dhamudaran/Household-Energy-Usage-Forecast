PowerPulse: Household Energy Usage Forecast



1.	Data Understanding and Exploration:
○	Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and quality.
○	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
○	Handle missing or inconsistent data points.
○	Parse date and time into separate features.
○	Create additional features such as daily averages, peak hours, or rolling averages.
○	Normalize or scale the data for better model performance.
3.	Feature Engineering:
○	Identify relevant features for predicting global active power consumption.
○	Incorporate external data (e.g., weather conditions) if available.
4.	Model Selection and Training:
○	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
○	Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
○	Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
5.	Model Evaluation:
○	Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
○	Compare model performance and select the best-performing model.
